# Engineering Thesis - Spring +  Angular + Kubernetes

the topic of my engineering thesis:
### <p align="center">USE OF PLATFORM KUBERNETES FOR APPLICATION BUILDING SUPPORTING BASE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT</p>
##
The yaml files for creating all the necessary aspects of the application can be found under the path: <p><i> Commerce / src / main / resources / </i> </p>

To deploy Application on Kubernetes cluster I have used several VMs (with Ubuntu OS) using Kubeadm tool.
- Used <b>PostgreSQL</b> as database's aspect. 
- Backend has been written in <b>Spring Boot</b>.
- <b>Angular PWA</b> was used for creating frontend's side (along with <a href="https://material.angular.io/"><i>Angular materials</i></a> technology).

The containerized application (frontend and backend) can be found at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/gregvader98">docker hub</a>


<!--Applications include features such as:
- user authentication and authorization  <todo> -->
